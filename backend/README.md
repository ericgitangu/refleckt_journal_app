## 📋 Overview

The Reflekt Journal App backend is built on a serverless microservices architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and EventBridge. This architecture allows for scalable, maintainable, and independently deployable services with minimal operational overhead. Each service is responsible for a specific domain of the application and communicates through well-defined APIs and event-driven patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The backend follows a serverless, domain-driven microservices architecture with the following principles:

- **Serverless First**: Leveraging AWS Lambda for compute, eliminating server management
- **Service Independence**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Domain Separation**: Services are organized around business capabilities
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for client requests, with JWT authentication
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Using EventBridge for asynchronous communication
- **Shared Components**: Common code abstracted into a shared library

For a visual representation of our architecture, see the [Architecture Diagram](./infrastructure/docs/architecture.md).

## 🔧 Scripts and Build System

### Directory Structure

The project uses a consistent directory structure for scripts and logging:

```
backend/
├── scripts/           # Build and deployment scripts
│   ├── build-all.sh   # Builds all services
│   ├── common.sh      # Common utility functions
│   ├── init.sh        # Initializes the entire backend

│   └── services/      # Runtime service logs
├── common/            # Shared code library
└── [services]/        # Individual service directories
```

### Common Utilities (`common.sh`)

```bash
# Source the utilities
source ./scripts/common.sh

# Available functions:
log_info "Message"      # Info level logging
log_success "Message"   # Success level logging

wait_for_url            # Wait for endpoint to become available
```

### Build System

We've implemented an optimized build system using `cargo-lambda` for AWS Lambda function compilation and packaging.

#### Key Build System Features

1. **Specialized for Lambda**: Using `cargo-lambda` which is purpose-built for AWS Lambda development
2. **ARM64 Standardization**: Exclusively targeting ARM64 architecture for better performance and lower cost
3. **Simplified Workflow**: Handles both compilation and packaging in a single step
4. **No Root Required**: Tools are installed locally within the project directory

### Cross-Compilation Setup

The most common issue with building Lambda functions on macOS is the cross-compilation from macOS to Linux. We use musl-cross to handle this:

```bash
# Install musl-cross with aarch64 target
brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross --with-aarch64
```

If you already have musl-cross installed but are missing the aarch64 target, you can reinstall:

```bash
brew reinstall FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross --with-aarch64
```

#### Verifying musl-cross Installation

After installation, verify that the aarch64 compiler is available:

```bash
# Check if the compiler exists
ls -la "$(brew --prefix musl-cross)/bin/aarch64-linux-musl-gcc"

# Verify it can be executed
"$(brew --prefix musl-cross)/bin/aarch64-linux-musl-gcc" --version
```

If the compiler is not found, it might be because:
1. You installed musl-cross without the `--with-aarch64` flag
2. The compiler is installed but not in your PATH
3. Homebrew didn't link the binaries properly

#### Lightweight llvm-ar Setup

Our build system uses a lightweight llvm-ar replacement to avoid requiring the full LLVM toolchain:

```bash
# Set up the lightweight llvm-ar
./scripts/install-llvm-ar.sh
```

This script:
- Creates a symlink from system `/usr/bin/ar` to `llvm-ar` in the local bin directory
- Sets up appropriate environment variables to avoid needing the actual llvm-ar
- Includes verification to confirm it's working correctly

### OpenSSL-Based Cryptography

This project uses OpenSSL for all cryptographic operations, including JWT validation. We've chosen OpenSSL for its:

1. Better cross-platform compatibility, especially on ARM64
2. Comprehensive cryptographic functionality
3. Well-maintained and widely used implementation

By using OpenSSL with its vendored feature, we avoid platform-specific cryptographic dependencies and ensure consistent behavior across all deployment environments.

### ARM64-Only Approach

We've standardized on ARM64 (aarch64) as our exclusive target architecture for several reasons:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: ARM64 Lambda functions are ~20% cheaper than x86_64
2. **Better Performance**: Often provides better performance per dollar
3. **Native Mac Support**: Works better with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs
4. **Fewer Compatibility Issues**: Architecture-specific cryptography issues are avoided by using OpenSSL
5. **Future-Proof**: AWS is heavily investing in ARM-based solutions
6. **Simplified Setup**: By standardizing on one architecture, we avoid complexity and potential issues

### Rust Toolchain Configuration

All services use a consistent `rust-toolchain.toml` file:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "1.85.0"
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]
targets = ["aarch64-unknown-linux-musl"]
profile = "minimal"
```

This configuration:
- Pins the Rust version to 1.85.0
- Includes necessary components (rustfmt, clippy)
- Specifies only the ARM64 target
- Uses the minimal profile for faster installation

### Centralized Environment Configuration

We use a centralized `set_env.sh` script that sets all environment variables in one place. Source it with:

```bash
# Source environment variables
source ./scripts/set_env.sh
```

This sets up:
- `TARGET`: The compilation target (`aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`)
- `RUST_VERSION`: The Rust version to use
- `OPENSSL_DIR`: Path to OpenSSL installation
- `AWS_LC_SYS_STATIC`: Prevents aws-lc-sys from compiling C code
- `AR`: Path to the ar tool (uses system ar on macOS)
- `CC_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl`: Path to the aarch64 C compiler

### Root-Level Cargo Config

We use a single root-level `.cargo/config.toml` file for all services to ensure consistency and maintainability. This approach:
- Ensures all services use the same configuration
- Reduces duplication across services
- Simplifies updating configuration settings
- Reduces the risk of configuration drift between services

### Special Handling for Ring and aws-lc-sys

The authorizer service uses the Ring cryptography library with a special patch for cross-compilation. Our build system:
- Uses Anoma's fork of Ring that avoids assembly code
- Makes aws-lc-sys optional and uses a dummy implementation
- Builds the authorizer with `--no-default-features` to avoid Ring assembly code

### Build Script (`build-all.sh`)

Builds all Lambda functions and services:

```bash
# Build all services
./scripts/build-all.sh

# Build with options
./scripts/build-all.sh --clean
```

The build script:
- Sets up the necessary Rust cross-compilation environment
- Builds the common library first
- Builds each service using Makefiles or cargo-lambda
- Logs all build output to logs/build/ for debugging
- Verifies Lambda packages

### Initialization Script (`init.sh`)

Sets up and deploys the entire backend stack:

```bash
# Initialize the backend
./scripts/init.sh

# Initialize with specific options
./scripts/init.sh -s staging -r us-west-2
```

The init script:
1. Checks prerequisites and AWS credentials
2. Sets up the Lambda build environment
3. Builds all services with cargo-lambda
4. Deploys the CloudFormation stack
5. Updates environment files for development
6. Creates test users and credentials
7. Tests endpoints to verify deployment
8. Configures the frontend to use the new backend

### Deployment Script (`deploy-stack.sh`)

Deploys the backend stack to AWS:

```bash
# Deploy to dev environment
./scripts/deploy-stack.sh -s dev

# Deploy with options
./scripts/deploy-stack.sh -s dev -r us-east-1 -b my-deploy-bucket -j my-jwt-secret
```

Available options:
- `-n`: Stack name (default: reflekt-journal)
- `-s`: Stage (dev, staging, prod)
- `-r`: AWS Region
- `-b`: S3 bucket for deployment artifacts
- `-j`: JWT secret (generated randomly if not provided)

### Local Tools Installation

Tools are installed locally to avoid requiring root/sudo privileges:

```bash
cd backend
./scripts/setup-aarch64-tools.sh
source setup-env.sh  # If you open a new terminal
```

This script:
- Downloads and installs necessary tools to the local `.local/bin` directory
- Creates a `setup-env.sh` script with necessary environment variables
- Does NOT require root/sudo privileges
- Sets the PATH to include the local tools directory

### Test Endpoints Script (`test-endpoints.sh`)

Tests all API endpoints and logs requests/responses for debugging:

```bash
# Test all endpoints
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh

# Test specific endpoint
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -e entries

# Test with options
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -e entries -v
```

The test script:
- Tests all service endpoints (entries, settings, analytics, ai, prompts)
- Performs CRUD operations on resources
- Logs all requests and responses for debugging
- Saves detailed logs to the logs directory

### Logger Configuration

All scripts use a consistent logging system that writes to the `logs/` directory:

- `logs/build/`: Contains logs from the build process
- `logs/init/`: Contains logs from initialization and deployment
- `logs/services/`: Contains runtime logs from services

This consolidated logging structure makes it easier to find and diagnose issues.

## ☁️ AWS Deployment

The backend is deployed to AWS using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) with CloudFormation.

### Deployment Steps

1. Build the SAM application:
   ```bash
   sam build --template-file infrastructure/template.yaml
   ```

2. Deploy using the provided script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-stack.sh -s dev -r us-east-1
   ```

   Available options:
   - `-n`: Stack name (default: reflekt-journal)
   - `-s`: Stage (dev, staging, prod)
   - `-r`: AWS Region
   - `-b`: S3 bucket for deployment artifacts
   - `-j`: JWT secret (generated randomly if not provided)

### AWS Resources

The deployment creates the following AWS resources:

- **API Gateway**: RESTful API with JWT authentication
- **Lambda Functions**: For each microservice

Each service contains its own tests. Run tests for all services:

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh

# Test individual endpoints
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -e entries -r us-east-1
```

The test script performs comprehensive testing including:
- Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources
- Testing search and filtering capabilities
- Testing specialized API endpoints
- Validating responses against expected schemas

### Debugging Tests

All API requests and responses are logged for debugging:

```bash
# View logs in the logs directory
cat ./logs/test_logs/create_entry-response.json
```

### Load Testing

The test script also supports load testing:

```bash
# Run load tests
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -l -c 10 -n 100
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Environment-specific configuration is managed through:
