## üìã Overview

The Reflekt Journal App backend is built on a serverless microservices architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and EventBridge. This architecture allows for scalable, maintainable, and independently deployable services with minimal operational overhead. Each service is responsible for a specific domain of the application and communicates through well-defined APIs and event-driven patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The backend follows a serverless, domain-driven microservices architecture with the following principles:

- **Serverless First**: Leveraging AWS Lambda for compute, eliminating server management
- **Service Independence**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Domain Separation**: Services are organized around business capabilities
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for client requests, with JWT authentication
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Using EventBridge for asynchronous communication
- **Shared Components**: Common code abstracted into a shared library

For a visual representation of our architecture, see the [Architecture Diagram](./infrastructure/docs/architecture.md).

```bash
# Test all endpoints
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh

# Test specific endpoint
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -e entries

# Test with options
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -e entries -v
```

The test script:
- Tests all service endpoints (entries, settings, analytics, ai, prompts)
- Performs CRUD operations on resources
- Logs all requests and responses for debugging
- Saves detailed logs to the test-logs directory

### Deployment Script (`deploy-stack.sh`)

Deploys the backend stack to AWS:

```bash
# Deploy to dev environment
./scripts/deploy-stack.sh -s dev

# Deploy with options
./scripts/deploy-stack.sh -s dev -r us-east-1 -b my-deploy-bucket
```

### Lambda Verification Script (`verify-lambda.sh`)

Verifies Lambda function builds and configurations:

```bash
# Verify all Lambda functions
./scripts/verify-lambda.sh

# Verify specific function
./scripts/verify-lambda.sh prompts-service
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lambda Build System

We've implemented an optimized build system using `cargo-lambda` for AWS Lambda function compilation and packaging.

### Key Build System Features

1. **Specialized for Lambda**: Using `cargo-lambda` which is purpose-built for AWS Lambda development
2. **ARM64 Standardization**: Exclusively targeting ARM64 architecture for better performance and lower cost
3. **Simplified Workflow**: Handles both compilation and packaging in a single step
4. **No Root Required**: Tools are installed locally within the project directory

### Rust Toolchain Configuration

All services use a consistent `rust-toolchain.toml` file:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "1.85.0"
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]
targets = ["aarch64-unknown-linux-musl"]
profile = "minimal"
```

This configuration:
- Pins the Rust version to 1.85.0
- Includes necessary components (rustfmt, clippy)
- Specifies only the ARM64 target
- Uses the minimal profile for faster installation

### Architecture-Specific Settings

The build system uses architecture-specific settings via `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-musl]
rustflags = []
env = { 
  "CC_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl" = "clang", 
  "AR_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl" = "llvm-ar", 
  "CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_MUSL_RUSTFLAGS" = "-Clink-self-contained=yes -Clinker=rust-lld" 
}

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=-avx512f"]
env = { "CFLAGS" = "-mno-avx512f" }
```

This addresses common issues with ARM64 builds, particularly with the `ring` crate, by:
- Using clang/LLVM toolchain for ARM64 builds
- Setting specific environment variables required by the ring crate
- Removing x86_64-specific AVX512 flags that cause errors on ARM

### Why ARM64 Only?

We've standardized on ARM64 (aarch64) for several reasons:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: ARM64 Lambda functions are ~20% cheaper than x86_64
2. **Better Performance**: Often provides better performance per dollar
3. **Native Mac Support**: Works better with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs
4. **Fewer Compatibility Issues**: Avoids some x86_64-specific issues (like AVX512)
5. **Future-Proof**: AWS is heavily investing in ARM-based solutions
6. **Simplified Setup**: By standardizing on one architecture, we avoid complexity

### Build System Components

The Lambda build system includes:
- `build-all.sh`: Builds all services using cargo-lambda
- `setup-aarch64-tools.sh`: Installs necessary tools locally for ARM64 builds
- `setup-toolchain.sh`: Ensures consistent toolchain configuration
- `setup-env.sh`: Generated by setup script to set environment variables
- `Makefile`: Provides easy-to-use commands for building and deploying

### Local Tools Installation

Tools are installed locally to avoid requiring root/sudo privileges:

```bash
cd backend
./scripts/setup-aarch64-tools.sh
source setup-env.sh  # If you open a new terminal
```

This script:
- Downloads and installs LLVM/clang to the local `.local/bin` directory
- Creates a `setup-env.sh` script with necessary environment variables
- Does NOT require root/sudo privileges
- Sets the PATH to include the local tools directory

### Maintaining Consistent Toolchain

To ensure all services have the correct toolchain configuration:

```bash
cd backend
./scripts/setup-toolchain.sh
```

### Building Lambda Functions

```bash
# Build all services
cd backend
make build-all

# Build a specific service
cd backend
make build-lambda-SERVICE  # Replace SERVICE with the service name
```

### Troubleshooting Lambda Builds

If you encounter build failures with the `ring` crate on ARM64:

1. Make sure you've run `./scripts/setup-aarch64-tools.sh` to install clang/LLVM locally
2. Ensure the environment is set up correctly by sourcing `source setup-env.sh`
3. Verify the correct environment variables are set:
   - CC_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl=clang
   - AR_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl=llvm-ar
   - CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_MUSL_RUSTFLAGS
4. Check that the PATH includes the local tools directory: `echo $PATH | grep .local/bin`

For general issues:
1. **Missing Toolchain Files**: Run `./scripts/setup-toolchain.sh` to ensure all services have the correct configuration
2. **Version Mismatch**: Verify that Rust 1.85.0 is installed with `rustup toolchain list`
3. **Build Logs**: Check the logs in `backend/build-logs/` for detailed error information

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment

The backend is deployed to AWS using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) with CloudFormation.

### Deployment Steps

1. Build the SAM application:
   ```bash
   sam build --template-file infrastructure/template.yaml
   ```

2. Deploy using the provided script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-stack.sh -s dev -r us-east-1
   ```

   Available options:
   - `-n`: Stack name (default: reflekt-journal)
   - `-s`: Stage (dev, staging, prod)
   - `-r`: AWS Region
   - `-b`: S3 bucket for deployment artifacts
   - `-j`: JWT secret (generated randomly if not provided)

### AWS Resources

The deployment creates the following AWS resources:

- **API Gateway**: RESTful API with JWT authentication
- **Lambda Functions**: For each microservice
- **DynamoDB Tables**: For storing entries, settings, categories, and analytics
- **EventBridge**: For service-to-service communication
- **CloudWatch**: For logs and monitoring
- **IAM Roles**: With least-privilege permissions
- **S3 Buckets**: For deployment artifacts and static content
- **KMS**: For encryption of sensitive data (optional)

## üß™ Testing

### Automated API Testing

Each service contains its own tests. Run tests for all services:

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh

# Test individual endpoints
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -e entries -r us-east-1
```

The test script performs comprehensive testing including:
- Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources
- Testing search and filtering capabilities
- Testing specialized API endpoints
- Validating responses against expected schemas

### Debugging Tests

All API requests and responses are logged for debugging:

```bash
# View logs in the test-logs directory
cat ./test-logs/create_entry-response.json
```

### Load Testing

The test script also supports load testing:

```bash
# Run load tests
./scripts/test-endpoints.sh -l -c 10 -n 100
```

## üîß Configuration

Environment-specific configuration is managed through:

1. **CloudFormation Parameters**: Set during deployment
2. **Environment Variables**: Passed to Lambda functions
3. **SSM Parameter Store**: For sensitive configuration

Key configuration options:
- `Stage`: Deployment environment (dev, staging, prod)
- `JwtSecret`: Secret for signing JWT tokens
- `LogLevel`: Logging verbosity

## üìù API Documentation

API documentation is available after deployment:

- REST API documentation: `https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>/api-docs`
